# Finding the joy in FUN data
### Description
 Instead of finding the story, let's find the joy. This session will be about using data tools to analyze data for FUN; we might look at some data from the Great British Bake Off, or Harry Potter, or UFO sightings, or Billboard's Hot 100. These datasets can be great for practicing your skills when you're not working on a data story for the newsroom. Or you just might find that fun data has a place on your news website; who knows! Come and explore some fun data. We'll use spreadsheets and R, but you don't need to be proficient in both.
### Class Requirements
This material will make sense if you have a good understanding of the basics of data analysis: sorting, filtering and grouping, whether in spreadsheets, SQL, or another program.
